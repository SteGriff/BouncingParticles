# Tasks for beginner programmers

## Make all the Atoms come out bigger
 * Look in Emitter.Emit, at the Diameter variable.
 * This generates a random number... think about how it might be working
 * It makes the Atoms between 4 and 12 pixels
 * Change Diameter to make them range between 10 and 18 pixels
 
## Make the "emitter" go anywhere the user clicks, not just on a strict line
 * Look in Workspace_Click and change the second parameter
 * Think about using MousePosition.Y and see what this does
 
## Make Atoms come out squashed (half their usual height)
 * Look in Atom.Draw and Atom.UnDrawLast
 * You can divide the last parameter to DrawEllipse by 2 but you will have to wrap the calculation in CInt() so it might look like CInt(something / 2)
 
## Make Atoms draw a blue "ghost" 50 pixels to their right.
 * Looks in Atom.Draw
 * You will need to copy and paste the line which creates the 'particlePen' to create a 'bluePen' and then use this to Draw a second Ellpise
 * When you run this code, the ghosts form a trail. Why do you think this is?
